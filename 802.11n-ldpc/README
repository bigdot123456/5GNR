Note

builHG          >       Only needed if not usign back substitution  (very slow)
ldpcTxSystem    >       Contain the message passing decoder matlab implementation (very slow)
                        Contain a message passing decoder C implementation [mexdecoder.c] (faster but not optimal)
ldpcTxSystemFast>       Contain a message passing decoder C implementation [mexfastdecoder.c] (fastest, but break the compatibility with the previous matlab code)
ldpcTest        >       Test for ldpcTxSystem
ldpcTestFast    >       Test for ldpcTxSystemFast


Not really useful file (SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DEPRECATED):
buildHG
ldpcTxSystem
ldpcTest
mexdecoder.c

## MATLAB R2016

From this version of MATLAB (maybe also others before), MATLAB tries to start a parallel pool automatically when a parfor keywork is reached, making the flag parallelComputation unuseful.

To disable this go to unchek Preferences > Parallel computating toolbox > Automaticallly create parallel pool.

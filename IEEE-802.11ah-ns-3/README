### Installation and usage instructions ###
* Download source code from our repository.
* Change into ./802.11ah-ns3/ns-3 directory.  
* Build and run:

    ./waf --run "s1g-mac-test --seed=1 --simulationTime=60 --payloadSize=256 --Nsta=32 --NRawSta=32 --BeaconInterval=100000 --DataMode="OfdmRate7_8MbpsBW2MHz" --datarate=7.8  --bandWidth=2 --rho="50" --TrafficPath="./OptimalRawGroup/traffic/data-32-0.82.txt" --S1g1MfieldEnabled=false --RAWConfigFile="./OptimalRawGroup/RawConfig-32-2-2.txt" "

Note: if errors related to nullptr arise when compiling, CXXFLAGS should be included into the "./waf configure" command,as follows:   

CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x" ./waf configure --disable-examples --disable-tests

  
### RAW related parameters: ###
* NRawSta:             Number of stations supporting RAW. 
* RAWConfigFile:       RAW configuration are stored in this file.

      The RAWConfigFile "./OptimalRawGroup/RawConfig-32-2-2.txt" used in the above command sets 2 RAW group for 32 stations, each RAW group contains 2 RAW slots. This file contains three lines:

    2                                                                                                          
    0	1	1	412	2	0	1	16	
    0	1	1	412	2	0	17	32

line 1: number of RAW Groups                                 
line 2 and line 3, information for each RAW groups, including

          * RawControl           Whether RAW can be accessed by any stations within the RAW group or only the paged stations within the RAW group.  
          * CrossSlotBoundary    Whether STAs are allowed to transmit after the assigned RAW slot boundary.
          * SlotFormat           Format of RAW slot count.                 
          * NRawSlotCount        Used to calculate number of RAW slot duration.   
          * NRawSlotNum          Number of slots per RAW group.                     
          * Page                 Page index of the subset of AIDs.
          * Aid_start            Station with the lowest AID allocated in the RAW.
          * Aid_end              Station with the highest AID allocated in the RAW.


Notes:   
          1. RawControl, currently set to 0, RAW can be accessed by any stations within the RAW group.            
          2. CrossSlotBoundary, currenty set to 1, only cross slot boundary are supported.                    
          3. RAW slot duration = 500 us + NRawSlotCount * 120 us, NRawSlotCount is y = 11(8) bits   length when SlotFormat is set to 1(0), and NRawSlotNum is (14 - y) bits length.                                     
          4. The above  RAWConfigFile assumes BeaconInterval is 100000 us and whole beacon is occupied by the RAW group. Users can adjust the parameters based on their own needs.                       


### Wi-Fi mode parameters ###
* DataMode:           Data mode.  
* datarate:           Data rate of data mode.  
* bandWidth:          BandWidth of data mode.  

  Note: Relation between the above 3 parameters and MCS is described in file "MCStoWifiMode".       

### Other parameters ###
* SimulationTime:     Simulatiom time in seconds after all stations get associated with AP.  
* payloadSize:        Size of payload.                   
* BeaconInterval:     Beacon interval time in us.    
* UdpInterval:        Traffic mode, station send one packet every UdpInterval seconds.  
* Nsta:               Number of total stations.  
* rho:                Maximal distance between AP and stations.   
* seed:               Seed of RandomVariableStream.
* TrafficPath:        Include traffic of each stations, packet sending interval can be automatically calcualted based on payloadSize. The above TrafficPath "./OptimalRawGroup/traffic/data-32-0.82.txt" contains traffic of 32 stations, and the total traffic is 0.82 Mbps.
* S1g1MfieldEnabled:     Packet using 1 Mhz bandwidth if set to "true".


### TIM and page slice parameters ###
* pagePeriod:       Number of Beacon Intervals between DTIM beacons that carry Page Slice element for the associated page
* pageIndex:        Index of the page (0-3) whose slices are served during beacon intervals within a page period, default value is 0
* pageSliceLength:  Number of blocks in each TIM for the associated page except for the last TIM (1-31)
* pageSliceCount:   Number of TIMs in a single page period (0-31), value 0 has special meaning
* blockOffset:      The 1st page slice starts with the block with blockOffset number, default value is 0
* timOffset:        Offset in number of Beacon Intervals from the DTIM that carries the first page slice of the page, default value is 0

    Example run: ./waf --run "s1g-mac-test-pageslice --pagePeriod=4 --pageSliceLength=8 --pageSliceCount=4"
                 --pagePeriod=4: every 4th beacon is DTIM beacon that carries Page Slice element for pageIndex=0
                 --pageSliceLength=8: each page slice cosists of 8 blocks, meaning that each page slice (PS) accomodates up to 512 stations (8 blocks * 8 subblocks * 8 stations)
                                      (TIM0: 1-512, TIM1: 513-1024, TIM2: 1025-1536, TIM3: 1537-2048)
                                      The last page slice can have different length.
                 --pageSliceCount=4: 4 TIMs are scheduled in one page period.
    
    Note: RAW configuration must be in line with TIM and page configuration. If a RAW group is reserved for a station in beacon interval that does not correspond to its TIM, station will be asleep during that RAW.
